-	Quiting server causes General protection fault, gg

-	IMplement server stat settings
-	Increase FlagAttacked / FlagDefended stat radius
-	Stop MA stats from being awarded when a groundhit splashes and kills a low HP target in the air.
-	Limit class replication to once per level.
-	Avoid NM_Client to call SaveConfig(). Need to think about the implications that it will have with the config variables that have to be received from the server....
	(Server shoud store vars on HDD, client should "load" them through replication)

-	Check BodyBlock stat
