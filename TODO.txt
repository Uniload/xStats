==================== REQUIREMENTS V1 ====================

-	Find a workaround to StaticSaveConfig / Maybe GlobalConfig ?

	NOTE: StaticSaveConfig() will save the defaultproperties in xStats.ini at server startup. any changes made to xStats.ini
	while the server is running will be overwritten by wathever value was declared at startup. Changes to the config file would
	therefore only work if the server is turned off. ( workaround: Only call StaticSaveConfig() if xStats.ini is missing?)

-	Increase performance replication block reliable / unreliable stat variables etc

==================== REQUIREMENTS V1+ ====================
-	Increase FlagAttacked / FlagDefended stat radius
-	Stop MA stats from being awarded when a groundhit splashes and kills a low HP target in the air.
-	Dynamic stat generation with stat template?
